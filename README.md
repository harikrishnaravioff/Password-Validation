# Password-Validation
Password validation is the process of checking if a user's password meets specific criteria, such as minimum length, and the required presence of uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters
## Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

### Objective
- Understand and demonstrate what makes a password strong.
- Test passwords against online password strength checkers.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. *Create Multiple Passwords:*
   - Example set:
     - hello123
     - Sunrise!2025
     - P@s$w0RD!321
     - F@gB7#92kLpZ
     - Coffee_is_Great_2025!

2. *Test Each Password Online:*  
   Use a free password strength checker (e.g., passwordmeter.com, howsecureismypassword.net, etc.).
   - Enter each password and note:
     - *Strength score*
     - *Feedback comments*

     Password                | Strength Score & Feedback Example                       
   |-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
   | hello123                | Weak – Too short, no symbols, easy to guess             |
   | Sunrise!2025            | Moderate – Adds uppercase, number, symbol               |
   | P@s$w0RD!321            | Strong – Mixed case, numbers, special characters, long  |
   | F@gB7#92kLpZ            | Very strong – Long, random, all character types         |
   | Coffee_is_Great_2025!   | Strong – Passphrase style, long, symbols & numbers      |

3. *Note Best Practices Learned:*
   - Use at least 12 characters.
   - Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
   - Avoid dictionary words and obvious substitutions.
   - Use *passphrases* (easy to remember, hard to guess).

4. *Research Common Password Attacks:*
   - *Brute-force:* Trying all possible combinations until the password is cracked.
   - *Dictionary attack:* Trying common words and known passwords.
   - Passwords found in data breaches are often targeted first.

5. *Summarize Password Complexity and Security:*
   - The longer and more random a password, the harder it is to crack.
   - Adding symbols, mixed-case, and numbers increases resistance against attacks.
   - Avoid patterns and personal info.

6. *Tips for Creating Strong Passwords:*
   - Use password managers to generate and store complex passwords.
   - Enable multi-factor authentication wherever available.
   - Change passwords regularly and never reuse them on important accounts.

### Interview Questions & Answers

*1. What makes a password strong?*  
A strong password is long (at least 12 characters), uses a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters, and avoids dictionary words or easy patterns.

*2. What are common password attacks?*  
Brute-force, dictionary attacks, credential stuffing, phishing.

*3. Why is password length important?*  
Longer passwords exponentially increase the time required to brute-force.

*4. What is a dictionary attack?*  
Attempts to crack a password by systematically entering words from a dictionary.

*5. What is multi-factor authentication?*  
A security measure that requires two or more proofs of identity to grant access—e.g., password and OTP.

*6. How do password managers help?*  
They generate, store, and autofill strong, unique passwords for every site.

*7. What are passphrases?*  
Long, easy-to-remember phrases made up of random words, symbols, and numbers—e.g., River!Cat_Orange4Moon.

*8. What are common mistakes in password creation?*  
Using short passwords, dictionary words, personal info, or reusing the same password on multiple sites.
